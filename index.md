### We Are Lucky to Have You

There is no one other than you I can imagine doing this with.  I know it feels like we go 'round and 'round some times, but it is love we are circling and building on.  You are 1/3rd of my *why*, the organizing principle of our family's whole world, and we love you very, very much.

# Happy Mothers Day 2022
